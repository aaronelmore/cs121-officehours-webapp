Greetings from the {{request.course_offering.catalog}} Office Hours!

We wanted to let you know that we have scheduled you to attend office hours at {{request.actual_slot.interval}} on {{request.actual_slot.date}}.

As a reminder, you provided the following Zoom URL: {{request.zoom_url}}

Please make sure this meeting is open during your scheduled time. An instructor/TA will join the meeting sometime during your scheduled slot.

If you are not planning to attend office hours after all, please cancel your request at https://cs121-officehours.cs.uchicago.edu/. Cancelling a request will not affect your standing in future requests and, once you cancel your request, you will be allowed to make another request for the same day.
