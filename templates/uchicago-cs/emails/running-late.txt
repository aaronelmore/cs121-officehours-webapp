Greetings from the {{request.course_offering.catalog}} Office Hours.

This is a courtesy message to let you know that the instructor/TA who is scheduled to help you is still busy helping another student, and may not be able to join your Zoom meeting during your scheduled {{request.actual_slot.interval}} slot. However, they are aware of your request, and will join the Zoom meeting as soon as they are done helping the other student.

If you need to reschedule your request to another time, please cancel your request at https://cs121-officehours.cs.uchicago.edu/ so you can submit a new request. Cancelling a request will not affect your standing in future requests and, once you cancel your request, you will be allowed to make another request for the same day.
