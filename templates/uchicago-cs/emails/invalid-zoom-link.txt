Greetings from the {{request.course_offering.catalog}} Office Hours.

This is a courtesy e-mail to let you know that we tried to join the Zoom meeting you provided ({{request.zoom_url}}) but the link does not appear to work. Please send us an updated Zoom link by replying-all to this e-mail.

If you are not planning to attend office hours after all, please cancel your request at https://cs121-officehours.cs.uchicago.edu/. Cancelling a request will not affect your standing in future requests and, once you cancel your request, you will be allowed to make another request for the same day.
